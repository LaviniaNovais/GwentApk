Ported version of Gwent Classic

This is an .apk port of Gwent Classic by Arun Sundaram (https://github.com/asundr/gwent-classic). I made necessary adaptations to the original files, but I give credit to him for the code.
If anyone wants to improve the app, feel free. I made this for my personal use when I'm on long-hours bus trip without internet connection. So, this might not work on every device as I only tested it on my tablet and phone. I also don't plan to make new versions to fix any issues or bugs, so don't expect updates.
